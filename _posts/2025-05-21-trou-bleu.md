# Hiking the Trou Bleu Loop from Trépaillard

The Trou Bleu (Blue Hole in English) is more than just a pretty spot—it’s part of a fascinating geological system in the Jura mountains. This area was formed millions of years ago during the Miocene, when tectonic forces pushed up layers of limestone to create the folded structures that define the region today. The Trou Bleu itself is a *karst spring*, meaning the water resurfaces here after flowing through an underground network of limestone channels. It's fed by nearby lakes like Bellefontaine and les Mortes, which lose part of their water into the ground through sinkholes. That water re-emerges here, often icy cold and strikingly blue due to the limestone filtering.

# Drone Time

I had a quick test flight of my DJI Neo drone to get a video of the elevated train line that runs throught the forrest.

If I was more confident I would have flown it through the arches but I'm just starting out and didn't fancy crashing in a forest with no way of retrieving the drone.

# Tour de Sewer
While this is a lovely walk overall, one downside is the east-side suspension bridge, which crosses above what appears to be a treatment plant—an odd contrast to the natural beauty of the surroundings.
