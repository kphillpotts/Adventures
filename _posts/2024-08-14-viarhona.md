With a small window of freedom whilst grand-parents are visiting to look after the kids - it was time for Tamara and I to spend some time doing some travel cycling from through France. Specifically along the [ViaRhona](https://en.viarhona.com/) cycle path from Lyon through to the Mediterannian coast.

Given we were a bit short of time, we couldn't do the entire EuroVelo 17 / ViaRhona route which extends from [The Furka Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furka_Pass) in Switzerland through to [Port Saint Louis du Rhône](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh%C3%B4ne) in France - we have also cycled much of the Swiss parts previously as well, so we decided we would start from Vienne and head down to [Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille) at the bottom of France.


## Day 1 - Lyon to Tain-l'Hermitage

We started off our adventures by throwing our bikes on a train from Geneva to Vienne (via Lyon).

Unfortunately, when we went to get on the train from Lyon to Vienne there was a problem because all the bicycle spots on the train were taken. 

> Lesson Learnt: 
If you are travelling on a train where you can't pre-book a bike space, be first on the platform! Be prepared to kill other bicycle passengers if necessary.

So yeah, decision time - _wait for another train (and potentially not get on), or suck it up and cycle to our starting point of Lyon?_

# Mallorca Memories: Our Family Getaway

Hey family!

Just dropping in to give you all the scoop on our latest family adventure—we took off to the sunny shores of Mallorca! We teamed up with another family and stayed at the [Iberostar Selection Albufera Playa](https://www.iberostar.com/hoteles/mallorca/iberostar-albufera-playa), an all-inclusive resort that was absolutely perfect for our group.

### Poolside Paradise

Our days mostly revolved around the pool. Imagine us lounging under the warm sun, the kids splashing around, and yes, plenty of mojitos. We quickly established a routine: breakfast, pool, lunch, pool, maybe a nap, and then back to the pool again. It was the kind of repetitive I could really get used to!

### Mojito Mastery

I have to confess, we went a bit mojito crazy. Here isThe bartenders at the resort must have thought we were on a mission to try every variation they offered. (Maybe we were!) Each one was as delicious as the last—perfect for sipping by the pool.

### Virgin Mojito recipe

**Ingredients:**
- Fresh mint leaves
- Limes
- Sugar
- Crushed ice
- Sparkling water

**Instructions:**
1. Start by placing some mint leaves in a glass.
2. Squeeze the juice from half a lime into the glass.
3. Add a teaspoon of sugar.
4. Muddle the ingredients together to release the mint's flavor and dissolve the sugar.
5. Fill the glass with crushed ice.
6. Top up with sparkling water.
7. Stir well, ensuring the sugar is fully dissolved.
8. Garnish with a sprig of mint and a lime wedge.
9. Serve and enjoy your refreshing Virgin Mojito!

### Feast Mode: Activated

The buffet at the resort deserves its own shout-out. Every meal was a feast and deciding what to eat was the hardest part of our day. Every dinner ended with us rolling back to our rooms, full and happy. I’m pretty sure I ate my body weight in seafood alone!

### A Little Adventure in Alcudia

We did venture out a few times! The market in Alcudia was a hit. It was so colorful and bustling with energy. We picked up some local treats and crafts—some of you might just find these in your Christmas stockings. ;)

### Kids’ Corner

The kids practically lived in the pool. It was great seeing them make friends and play from sunup to sundown. They were definitely sad to say goodbye to their new buddies and the endless pool games.

### Bike Ride Bliss

I managed to escape for a bit and hired a bike to explore the local scenery. It was liberating to ride along the coast, feel the breeze, and take in the stunning views. A much-needed break from my rigorous mojito testing duties!

### Signing Off

We’re back home now, missing the sun and fun, but so grateful for the memories we made. It was a fantastic way to spend time together and escape our everyday routines. Can’t wait to catch up with everyone soon—maybe we can plan a big family trip next time?

Sending loads of love and hoping to see all of you sooner rather than later!

Cheers to family, fun, and future adventures!
