With a small window of freedom whilst grand-parents are visiting to look after the kids - it was time for Tamara and I to spend some time doing some travel cycling from through France. Specifically along the [ViaRhona](https://en.viarhona.com/) cycle path from Lyon through to the Mediterannian coast.

Given we were a bit short of time, we couldn't do the entire EuroVelo 17 / ViaRhona route which extends from [The Furka Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furka_Pass) in Switzerland through to [Port Saint Louis du Rhône](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh%C3%B4ne) in France - we have also cycled much of the Swiss parts previously as well, so we decided we would start from Vienne and head down to [Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille) at the bottom of France.


## Day 1 - Part 1 - Geneva to Vienne

We started off our adventures by throwing our bikes on a train from Geneva to Vienne (via Lyon).

Unfortunately, when we went to get on the connecting train from Lyon to Vienne there was a problem because all the bicycle spots on the train were taken. 

> Lesson Learnt: 
If you are travelling on a train where you can't pre-book a bike space, be first on the platform! Be prepared to kill other bicycle passengers as required.

We had chosen Vienne as our starting point because we heard the route from Lyon to Vienne was pretty boring and industrial. But now we had a decision to make:
 _wait for another train (and potentially not get on), or suck it up and cycle to our starting point of Lyon?_

In the spirit of adventure we decided to suck it up! Was it a good idea? 

No... No it was not.

I don't have any photos on the route, but after starting of in quite a nice fashion from Lyon it degraded quickly into a 40km slog across highways and single track mountain bike trails that had our butts slightly broken before we even reached our starting point of Vienne.

Fortunately riding into Vienne was actually quite lovely
